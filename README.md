# QGIS-Vietnamese-Encodings-Converter
A QGIS plugin to convert Vietnamese between encodings.

This tool helps to convert charsets between encodings, from Vietnamese's UTF-8 to Internationalized (Unicode) and vice versa. 

For non-Vietnamese users, you can also use this tool to convert into ANSI characters (either "TCVN >> Khong dau" or "Unicode >> Khong dau".
